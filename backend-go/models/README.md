## Notes on Insert()

For Postgres, it will detect when something is generated by the database. It will show something like:
```go
	// insert (primary key generated and returned by database)
```
nevertheless, the struct is the same for every query. Meaning, in the case of updates we have to get the full object and pass the one updated with rest of options untouched. Perhaps its better to have it the sqlc way? Worth the extra SQL query?
